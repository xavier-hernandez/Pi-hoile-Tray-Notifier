# Pi-Hole-Tray-Notifier

One of my first electron apps. The app places a “pie” icon in your taskbar which while running will notify you of changes to your Pi-hole application.

Currently this app notifies you of the following every 5 seconds:  
  
  Modifications to:
* Total queries
* Queries blocked
* Percent blocked
* Domains on blocklist

Requirements:  
Pi-hole with API version 3 (tested using Pi-hole Version v4.3.1)
